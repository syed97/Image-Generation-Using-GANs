# Image-Generation-Using-GANs

This project was implemented for an assignment in my Computer Vision course at university. It involves the usage of Google's Quick, Draw! dataset to generate images for any category. It is implemented as a Python Notebook using Google Colab. The deep learning architecture followed was a Generative Adversarial Neural Network whcih combines a covolutional neual nework (CNN) as a discriminator and a deconvolutional neural network for image generation.

The parameters set in the model were implemented in a workshop held by Mr. Nouman Hasany, for the Fashion MNIST dataset. Special thanks to him for his wonderful explanations and for guiding this project.
